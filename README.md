# CRISPR-Cas9 Knockout Design Simulation in E. coli

This project simulates a gene knockout strategy for the lacZ gene in E. coli using CRISPR-Cas9. The design focuses on minimizing off-target effects and simulating plasmid construction.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Benchling (for plasmid design)
- SnapGene Viewer (for visualization)
- CRISPOR (for sgRNA design and validation)

## 🧪 Workflow Summary
1. Identified lacZ target site in E. coli genome.
2. Designed sgRNAs using CRISPOR with minimal off-targets.
3. Simulated cloning into plasmid backbone (SnapGene/Benchling).
4. Documented protocol and exported visuals.

## 📁 Files
- Protocol PDF: Stepwise CRISPR design process
- Plasmid GenBank file and map
- sgRNA summary and off-target data
- Image previews for documentation
